### Abstract
Mechanisms specifying amniotic ectoderm and surface ectoderm are still equivocal in human due to
their resemblances in expression patterns and signal requirements. This lack of knowledge hinders
legitimate strategies to recapitulate embryogenesis. Here, we developed a human pluripotent stem
cell model to investigate the divergence between these primordial tissues. We established a culture
condition that upregulates amnioblast genes and non-neural ectodermal genes in the function of cell
density. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on the in vitro amnioblast differentiation showed that
the developmental trajectory of amnioblast goes through a TFAP2A-abundant state which may be
permissive for surface ectoderm commitment. Interestingly, our culture system also generated
extraembryonic mesoderm-like cells from primed pluripotent state, some of which transiently
expressed embryonic mesodermal markers. Taken together, our study brings an integrative
understanding about the development of human amniotic and surface ectoderms, and provides a new
model to examine the generation of human extraembryonic mesoderm.
